.SS "optional arguments:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-sync\fR
synchronize packages (install/update). a sync
operation will attempt to install and/or update
packages. \fB\-S\fR by itself will attempt to install a list
of target packages.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-remove\fR
remove a package. this will call pacman on any AUR
based packages and remove them if installed.
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-query\fR
query package database. this option is used to find
out what AUR packages are currently installed on the
system.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-upgrades\fR
perform an upgrade of installed packages on the the
system. this will attempt to upgrade ALL AUR installed
packages. a list of target packages may also be
passed.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-search\fR
search for packages in the AUR. by passing a package
name to search the AUR rpc endpoints will be called to
attempt to find a package with a name or description
matching this input string
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR
clean the cache. this will clean the naaman cache area
of any cache files. this can be used to
invalidate/remove old cache information for deprecated
packages or to reset duration caching options.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-deps\fR
naaman will attempt to build a dependency chain for
the seperately for each package specified. upon
completion naaman will attempt to install (after
confirmation) the determined dependency chain.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
display version information about naaman
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-sudo\fR
disable calling sudo. by default when naaman has to
call pacman directly (e.g. \fB\-R\fR), it will call with sudo
if required. passing this option will prevent naaman
from using sudo.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
verbose output. this setting will change the output
formatting and enable DEBUG level output. use this to
begin to debug naaman and to see more detail.
.TP
\fB\-\-trace\fR
trace debug logging. this option is useful to dump
extensive naaman logging information for indepth
troubleshooting or debugging purposes.
.TP
\fB\-\-pacman\fR PACMAN
pacman config. when creating the pacman handle naaman
passes a configuration file to pacman for
initialization via pyalpm. this is NOT passed when
calling pacman directly (e.g. \fB\-R\fR).
.TP
\fB\-\-config\fR CONFIG
naaman config. specify the (optional) naaman
configuration file to use. please use man naaman.conf
for available options. naaman will read configs in the
order of (all optional): \fI\,/etc\/\fP, XDG_CONFIG_HOME , and
then \fB\-\-config\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-confirm\fR
naaman will not ask for confirmation. when performing
install, update, and remove operations naaman will ask
for the user to confirm the operation. to disable
these prompts pass this option. this option will not
suppress makepkg or pacman prompts (use REMOVAL or
MAKEPKG in the naaman.conf)
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
quiet various parts of naaman to display less. certain
operations will display more AUR package information
that will be quiet (displaying minimal package
information) if this option is provided.
.TP
\fB\-\-cache\-dir\fR CACHE_DIR
cache dir for naaman. naaman stores caching and
logging information to this location. naaman will
(attempt) to create this directory if it does not
exist.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-config\fR
do not load the config file. to prevent naaman from
loading the configuration file when running specify
this option. this can allow running a specify instance
of naaman without certain config options being loaded.
.TP
\fB\-\-builds\fR BUILDS
the location where naaman will perform builds. if not
set this will be in the temp (e.g. \fI\,/tmp\/\fP) area.
specifying this option will move where makepkg
operations are performed in the system.
.SS "Sync/Update options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-for\fR N [N ...]
ignore packages for periods of time (hours).
specifying this options allows for ignoring certain
packages over time. this is specified as
<package>=<hours>, where <package> will only check for
updates every <hours> period.
.TP
\fB\-\-vcs\-ignore\fR VCS_IGNORE
time betweeen vcs update checks (hours). specifying
this option will result in vcs\-based AUR packages to
only be updated (they will always update) every <hour>
threshold. default is 720 (30 days)
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-vcs\fR
perform all sync operations but skip updating any vcs
packages. this will allow for performing various sync
operations without always having vcs packages
updating.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-refresh\fR
refresh non\-vcs packages if there are updates in the
AUR for the package. packages with detected updates in
the AUR will be refreshed (assumes \fB\-U\fR).
.TP
\fB\-yy\fR, \fB\-\-force\-refresh\fR
similar to \fB\-y\fR but will force refresh over any
\fB\-\-ignore\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-for\fR, \fB\-\-vcs\-ignore\fR and disable any
rpc caching. Use this option to override the mentioned
flags and force update or installing a package set.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\fR N [N ...]
ignore packages by name. packages ignored will be
skipped during upgrades unless forced (\fB\-yy\fR). utilize
this to keep packages back and/or prevent upgrading
packages
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
skip caching package files. by default naaman will
take the resulting makepkg output packages and place
them in the pacman cache directory. setting this will
disable this operation.
.TP
\fB\-\-skip\-deps\fR
skip dependency checks. naaman will attempt to detect
and error when checking an AUR package for other AUR
packages that are NOT installed. setting this will
disable this check.
.TP
\fB\-\-reorder\-deps\fR
attempt to re\-order dependency installs. by setting
this, naaman will no longer try and re\-order
dependencies. this setting attempts to detect install
order and adjust to resolve any detected dependency
issues (e.g. \fB\-S\fR package1 package0 where package1
relies on package0 will change to install package0 and
then package1)
.TP
\fB\-\-rpc\-cache\fR RPC_CACHE
enable rpc caching (minutes). instead of making a web
rpc request to check for updated AUR package
information, naaman will cache the last received
information about a package for this duration of time
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-info\fR
display additional information about packages when
searching for information in the AUR. this is only
used during a search but will present as much
information as possible to the user about the result
package set. passing multiple i parameters will
increase verbose (e.g. \fB\-ii\fR)
.TP
\fB\-\-vcs\-install\-only\fR
by default when attempting a force update (\fB\-yy\fR) naaman
will attempt to download/clone the package and
determine the version for vcs packages. by settings
this flag when force updating naaman will skip the vcs
version check and force\-install the current version of
the vcs package regardless of what is currently
installed. disabling this would save bandwidth
.TP
\fB\-yyy\fR, \fB\-\-force\-force\-refresh\fR
similar to \fB\-yy\fR but will force force refresh over any
speciality checking (e.g. \fB\-\-vcs\-install\-only\fR). Use
this flag to update all AUR packages on the system
.SS "Query options:"
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gone\fR
specifying this option will check for packages
installed from the AUR but are no longer in the AUR.
